Idea 1: We will create an application that uses the weatherUSA API, and WebAPI from Spotify for Developers in order to generate spotify playlists
based on weather from a certain location. The database we intend to use is Microsoft SQL server. We intend to use 2 factor authentication by
sending a code via email or message to the user. Most likely we will use python for our back end coding.

Idea 2:
We will create an application that uses user inputs to tell them what to eat based on user inputs for desired taste (sour, sweet, tart, etc.).
Our app will use the documenU api and TraxMatching api in order to find restaurants that serve cuisine that match up with their respective tastes.
